        I wanted to pursue a career in computing since I was 12. I used to buy
        magazines that offered free tutorial usually in form of DVD then use to
        try on what I have learned. I continued to this path until 2010 when I
        got my Higher Diploma in Computer Science.

        Then I started my own business starting the opening of an Internet Cafe
        where I used to provide IT services such as repairing computers, selling
        them after I bought then in Bulks. I also provided computers repair
        service to other internet cafe's.

        After many years of trying different types of business than failing I
        finally decided to stick to my childhood dream which I was good and
        still good at anyway.
